    System.out.println(a--+++b);//line 2
    System.out.println(a++-++b);//line 3
    System.out.println(a+++++b);//line 4

b) line 2 
c) line 3
4) line 4

As + operator and ++ operator have equal precedence.
Similarly - and -- have equal precedence.
So in line 2 +++b and in line 4 +++b gives an error.
To solve this error we can use +(++b).
